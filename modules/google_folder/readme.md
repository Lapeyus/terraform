### Overview

This Terraform script is designed to manage Google Cloud Platform folders in a hierarchical structure. It provides an organized way to segregate resources and permissions, creating a layered folder structure.

### Code Description

1. **Variable Definition**: The `variable "folders"` block defines the structure of the folders, including optional attributes like `name`, `external_parent_id`, `audit_logs`, `org_policy`, etc.

2. **Resources**:
   - The `resource "google_folder"` blocks (from `layer1_folders` to `layer10_folders`) are responsible for creating different layers of folders. Each layer depends on the keys from the previous layer.
   - The `module "folders"` block specifies the actual folders to be created, including core structures like "Billing", "Security", etc.
   - The `resource "random_string"` block creates a random string, used potentially for naming or unique identification.

### Requisites

- **Terraform**: The code is written in Terraform, so you'll need Terraform installed to execute it.
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: You must have proper permissions and access to Google Cloud Platform as it interacts with Google Folder resources.

### Order of Execution

The order of execution is determined by the dependencies between the layers, starting from `layer1_folders` and proceeding up to `layer10_folders`.

### Logic

- The folders are created in layers, allowing a complex and nested structure.
- Parent-child relationships between folders are managed through keys, ensuring proper nesting and order.

### Pros

- **Modularity**: Easy to update and maintain.
- **Flexibility**: Customizable structure, allowing for a wide range of organizational schemes.
- **Readability**: Clear and descriptive variable names make the code more understandable.

### Cons

- **Complexity**: The numerous layers and relationships may be difficult to manage in larger environments.
- **Dependency Management**: Ensuring correct dependencies between layers requires careful consideration.

### `variable "folders"`

This variable is a map that contains the configuration for each folder. Let's explore the nested attributes:

- **`name`** (optional): The name of the folder. If not provided, the key of the map will be used.
- **`external_parent_id`** (optional): The ID of the parent resource if it exists outside the defined hierarchy.
- **`parent_entry_key`** (optional): A key referring to the parent entry in the variable, enabling hierarchical structure.
- **`iam`** (optional): A map of IAM policies to be applied to the folder.
- **`iam_mode`** (optional): Specifies the mode of the IAM policy, such as additive.
- **`audit_logs`** (optional): A map that includes details related to audit logs.
  - `service` (optional): The name of the audited service.
  - `log_type` (optional): The type of log.
  - `exempted_members` (optional): List of members exempted from audit logging.
- **`org_policy`** (optional): A list of organizational policy constraints.
  - `constraint` (optional): The name of the constraint.
  - `version` (optional): The version of the constraint.
  - `boolean_policy` (optional): Defines the boolean policy.
    - `enforced` (optional): Whether the policy is enforced or not.
  - `list_policy` (optional): List of policies.
    - `allow` (optional): An object defining allowed values.
      - `all` (optional): Allows all values.
      - `values` (optional): A list of allowed values.
    - `deny` (optional): An object defining denied values.
      - `all` (optional): Denies all values.
      - `values` (optional): A list of denied values.
    - `suggested_value` (optional): A suggested value for the policy.
    - `inherit_from_parent` (optional): Whether to inherit the policy from the parent.
  - `restore_policy` (optional): An object to define the restoration policy.
    - `default` (optional): Whether to restore to default.

### Default Value

- **`default = {}`**: An empty map is used as the default value for the `folders` variable. This ensures that if the variable is not explicitly set, it won't cause an error during execution.

### Usage

The variable `folders` should be populated with the desired configuration according to your organizational needs. Here's an example of how to use it:

```hcl
folders = {
  "Core" = {
    name               = "Core_Folder"
    external_parent_id = "organizations/my_org_id"
  }
}
```
